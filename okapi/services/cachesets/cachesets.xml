        <p>Retrieve information on a multiple cache sets in one request.</p>

        <p>Please see the <b>cacheset</b> method for more information about what
        cache sets are.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='cacheset_uuids'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of cacheset UUIDs. These represent the
        cachesets you are interested in. No more than 500 UUIDs are allowed.
        Unlike in the "cacheset" method, this CAN be an empty string (it will
        result in an empty, but valid, response).</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        <p>Same as in the services/cachesets/cacheset method. Pipe-separated list
        of ISO 639-1 language codes (preferred languages for fields like
        <b>name</b> and <b>description</b>).</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='fields' default='uuid|name|location|type|status'>
        <p>Same as in the services/cachesets/cacheset method. Pipe-separated list
        of field names which you are interested with.</p>
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary. Cacheset UUIDs you provide will be mapped to dictionary keys,
        and each value will be a dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>

        <p>Value of <b>null</b> means that no cacheset by this UUID has been found.
        (This behavior is different than in the services/cachesets/cacheset method, which
        responds with a HTTP 400 error in such case.)</p>
    </returns>
