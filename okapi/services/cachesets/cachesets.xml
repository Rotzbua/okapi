    <req name='cacheset_uuids'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of cacheset UUIDs. These represent the
        paths you are interested in. No more than 500 UUIDs are allowed.
        Unlike in the "cacheset" method, this CAN be an empty string (it will
        result in an empty, but valid, response).</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='langpref' default='en'>
        WRTODO (the same)
    </opt>
    <opt name='fields' default='uuid|name|location|type|status'>
        WRTODO (the same)
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary. Path UUIDs you provide will be mapped to dictionary keys,
        and each value will be a dictionary of fields you have selected.</p>

        <p>Value of <b>null</b> means that no cacheset by this UUID has been found.
        (This behavior is different than in the services/cachesets/cacheset method, which
        responds with a HTTP 400 error in such case.)</p>
